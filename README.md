# Stress Level Prediction

##  Project Overview
This project predicts a person's stress level using machine learning based on lifestyle factors such as sleep duration, screen time, and work habits.

## Dataset
- File: Stress_Dataset.csv
- Contains lifestyle-related features and corresponding stress levels

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Google Colab

## Model Used
- Linear Regression / Random Forest (edit according to what you used)

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Open `stress_level_prediction.ipynb`
3. Run all cells in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab

## Output
The model predicts stress level based on input lifestyle parameters and evaluates performance using accuracy metrics.

## Future Improvements
- Add more features like diet and exercise
- Deploy as a web app
- Improve accuracy using advanced models
